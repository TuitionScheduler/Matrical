In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson  declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the University.  Eloquent evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at Río Piedras in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at Mayagüez in 1911.  It was in the College of Agriculture where the Mayagüez Campus as we know it today had its origin.  Credit for the establishment of the College is given to the joint effort of D. W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), José de Diego, and Carmelo Alemar.  A year later, the school received the name that it bore for 50 years:  the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.  The strengthening and diversification of the academic programs at Mayagüez were recognized years later when, in 1942, as a result of university reform, the campus was organized with a considerable degree of autonomy into the Colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, and Science under the direction of a vice-chancellor.  The expansion continued through the 1950s when many programs flourished in the University.  The College of Arts and Sciences and the Nuclear Center were established in Mayagüez.  The Colleges of Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Business Administration emerged in Río Piedras.  The Schools of Medicine, Odontology, and Tropical Medicine were established in San Juan.  In 1966, the Legislative Assembly reorganized the University of Puerto Rico as a system of autonomous campuses, each under the direction of a chancellor.  The College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts became the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus.  Today, the Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico continues its development in the best tradition of a Land Grant institution.  It is a co-educational, bilingual, and non-sectarian school comprising the Colleges of Agricultural        Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Engineering, and the Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies.    The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the Agricultural Experiment Station and the Agricultural Extension Service.  At present, the campus population is composed of 13,316 students, 1,181 regular staff members and 625 members of the educational staff.    Accreditations and Affiliations  The Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico is fully accredited by the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico. It holds membership in the Middle States Commission on Higher Education since 1946. Our academic programs are accredited by professional entities such as the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE),  Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACSBSP),  The American Chemical Society, Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, Inc. (Formerly NLNAC), and ABET.     The Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico is a member of Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) since 1966.  ORAU is a private, non-profit consortium of 65 colleges and universities that acts as management and operating contractor for the US Department of Energy (DOE).

The University consists of the Mayagüez Campus, the Medical Sciences Campus, and the Río Piedras Campus, which are dedicated to both undergraduate and graduate education; and eight Campus at Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamón, Carolina, Cayey, Humacao, Ponce, and Utuado which provide undergraduate education.  Each autonomous institutional unit has a Chancellor as chief administrator and academic officer.  Governing Board    The Governing Board (JG) was created in 2013 as an independent and autonomous body that governs the system of 11 units comprising the University of Puerto Rico. Prior to its creation, these responsibilities were in charge of the former Higher Education Council and the former Board of Trustees (JS).  It is composed of 13 members, namely a regular undergraduate student, a regular graduate student, two tenured professors in the university system, the Secretary of Education, as an ex officio, a broad professional knowledge and experience in the field of finance, a resident of Puerto Rico who has participated with distinction in the social and community leadership, five residents of Puerto Rico featured in artistic knowledge, scientists and professionals, and a citizen residing in Puerto Rico, linked Puerto Rican communities abroad.  Except for the two students and two professors, who are elected, the other members of the Governing Board are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. All members of the Governing Board serve for staggered terms laid down in the University Act and until their successors are appointed and qualified.  The Governing Board elects its president from among its members.  It is responsible for:   • examining and reviewing the budgetary and institutional development plans of the University  • authorizing the institution of new campus, centers, and other institutional units appointing the President and chancellors of each autonomous unit  • defining rights and duties of various constituents in the institutional community  • defining student financial aid standards • preparing an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature on the state of the University of Puerto Rico  President   The President of the University, the chief executive officer of the University system, is appointed to an indefinite term by the Governing Board.  Subject to the approval of the Board, he appoints chancellors to the various campuses and colleges. The President represents the University on corporate matters before courts and government agencies. He acts as an ex-officio member of all the UPR faculties, academic senates, and administrative boards.  The President is responsible for submitting an annual budget, an annual report, the institutional development plan and its revisions, regulations, contracts, and agreements which require university approval.  He develops and maintains relationships with other cultural and educational institutions.

It was organized as a result of the University Act (PL1), which was approved on January 20, 1966 and amended by Law No. 16 in 1993.  Chancellor   The Chancellor of the Mayagüez Campus is the chief executive officer of the institutional unit.  The Chancellor’s main responsibilities include:   1. Presiding over the Administrative Board, the Academic Senate, and faculty meetings  2. Appointing deans, departmental directors and university personnel  3. Resolve controversial appeals against decisions made by deans  4. Representing  the campus at functions, ceremonies, and academic activities  5. Preparing the campus’ annual report and budget petition for submission to the President  Administrative Board   The Administrative Board of the Mayagüez Campus consists of the Chancellor as presiding officer, the deans, two academic senators elected among those faculty members of the Senate who are not ex-officio, senators, and an elected student representative.  The President of the University serves as an ex-officio member.  The Board acts as an advisory body to the Chancellor, prepares the development plan of the Campus, approves the proposed budget prepared by the Chancellor, and grants tenure, promotions and leaves of absence.  Academic Senate  The Academic Senate at UPRM is composed by the members of the Administrative Board, the Director of the Library, the Director of the Counseling Office, representatives elected from the faculties whose total must not be  less than twice the number of the elected ex-officio members, an elected member of the  Library and Counseling Office, and ten student representatives.  The Academic Senate is the official forum of the academic community.  Its main task is to participate in the formulation of academic processes within the University’s legal structure. Faculty  The faculty is composed of the chancellor, the deans, department directors and the teaching personnel.  The General Regulations of the University of Puerto Rico define the faculty's functions, privileges, duties, and, rights.  Students  The rights and duties of students are set forth in the General Student Regulations. The General Student Council represents students before the university administration, and individual student councils represent them before each of their respective colleges and schools.  The students are also represented on the Academic Senate, the Administrative Board, the University Board, and the Governing Board.  Student Ombudsman Office     The Students Ombudsman Office was created on November 10, 1999.  It is a direct result of the interest and effort of both the Chancellor and the Students General Council.  Its creation reinforces our University’s belief in dialogue and communication as the best way to pursue truth and the integral development of its students. It also provides adequate and appropriate conditions which enhance their quality of life.  The mission of the Students Ombudsman Office (Oficina de Procuraduría Estudiantil) is to provide an independent, confidential, neutral, and accessible individual support for our students.  The informal process facilitates fair solutions to the situations and problems of the parties involved.  The Students Ombudsman Office does not do formal investigations. Instead we listen to people, examine their options for dealing with a particular situation and help guide them toward making wise and healthy decisions.  Moreover, the Office offers timely and relevant information concerning campus policies and procedures. The Office welcomes all community members, including professors and employees that wish to present any situation related to students.   Office: Luis D.

The  fundamental  right  of   University students in the academic community is the right to an education.  This right is not limited to the classroom but encompasses the aggregate of the students' possible relations and experiences with their fellow students, teachers, and administrators at the University and with their fellow citizens in the community at large.  In like manner, the students' principal duty consists of fully exercising that right and conducting themselves in a manner that does not hinder other community members in the exercise of their rights or in the fulfillment of their duties. B.   These regulations cover separately:             (1) student rights and duties inherent in the sphere of the educational program;          (2) those pertaining to extracurricular activities within the facilities of the University; (3) those related to student participation in the different aspects of institutional services; (4) those indicated by the standards and restrictions characteristic of academic life; and (5) the sanctions corresponding to violations of regulations and the procedure for the imposition of these sanctions.  Article 2   A. The  work involved in the subject under study constitutes the basis of teacher-student relationship.  Maximum integrity and intellectual honesty should govern the drive to attain knowledge.  The teacher shall foster creative dialogue and freedom of discussion and expression among students.  The student shall have the opportunity to present reasonable objections to the facts and opinions stated by the teacher if in disagreement.  Both may examine any aspect of the subject under discussion in accordance with the standards of intellectual responsibility vital to all academic endeavors.  Neither one nor the other shall use the classroom as a forum to preach political, sectarian, religious, or other doctrines alien to the subjects being taught.  The right to dissent from the opinion of the teacher does not release the student from the responsibility of complying with the teacher’s requirements for the course.  The student’s grade shall be based on considerations relative to  academic achievements measured in the varying ways in which this is possible. B.     The basis of the teacher-student relationship is trust and confidence which should be respected by both and by the administration.  Opinions and beliefs expressed by students in the classroom are of a privileged nature, and students are entitled to have their teachers refrain from disclosing them to third parties.  The preceding does not bar teachers from stating opinions about students' character and abilities or from discussing their progress with colleagues as part of the academic program and of the students' formative process. C.  The relationship between students and teachers outside the classroom constitutes a part of the educational process.  Students     shall have the right to meet with teachers at specially designated times to request guidance on and clarification of aspects of their academic work. D.    Academic and disciplinary files shall be kept separate.  Any information relative to disciplinary files shall not be made available to unauthorized persons within or outside the University without the students' consent except by a court order.  No record of the students' political beliefs shall be kept.  The legal and academic tradition recognizes the rights of students as members of the University community and also the obligation of moral and intellectual responsibility concomitant with these rights.  The legal and academic tradition also recognizes the responsible participation of students in assuring and maintaining order, safety, and normalcy of academic life.  These rights and responsibilities, the disciplinary procedures for dealing with their violation, and many other matters of interest are described in the UPRM Student Manual (Reglamento de Estudiantes del Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez) available in the Office of the Dean of Students.

The University will monitor the student's progress to make sure that he or she will finish the degree without surpassing the 150% limit, If, at the moment of evaluation, it is determined that the student will not be able to finish the degree without surpassing this limit, the student will not be able to continue participating in the financial aid programs. The 150% maximum will apply regardless of whether the student has not received previous financial aid. E. Curricular sequences and other courses additional to the student's major - The student will be able to receive financial aid for all courses required by his or her major, including college requirements, general education requirements, and electives. Also, the student may receive financial aid for the following, according to the conditions outlined below: 1. Additional required courses (prerequisites, basic skill courses, and remedial courses) - The student may receive financial aid for up to 30 credit-hours in courses required by the institution in addition to the major. 2. Curricular sequences - Students admitted to a curricular sequence duly approved by the existing norms will be able to attempt up to 150% of the credit-hours required by his or her major plus 100% of the credit-hours required by the curricular sequence, without losing their academic eligibility. a) Caveat - The By-laws of Title IV Programs of the Department of Education do not allow students to take teacher certification courses in addition to their major if the campus where the student is enrolled offers a complete teacher preparation program in the student's major. F. Transfers and major changes - In the case of students who transfer from another accredited institution or from another campus of the University, as well as students who change majors, academic eligibility will be determined as follows: 1. On the basis of only those credit-hours that are accredited towards the academic program to which the student has transferred or changed. The University of Puerto Rico is duty-bound to perform all equivalency processes before the enrollment of these students, so that they will be aware beforehand of the credit-hour margin that they will have for participation in financial aid programs. G. Articulated transfers - For the purpose of participation in financial aid programs, students enrolled in articulated transfer programs will be evaluated on the basis of the requirements stated in the corresponding articulation agreements signed by participating campuses. H. Readmissions - A student who is readmitted to the academic program in which he or she was previously enrolled will be evaluated according to the rules in effect at the moment of readmission, and the evaluation will take place at the end of the academic year. Students who are readmitted to a new academic program will be evaluated according to the criteria outlined for major changes in clause V-D. I. In the case of curricular revisions - Curricular revisions are not retroactive. They apply only to students admitted after the date in which the curricular revision goes into effect. However, if a student chooses to be bound by the revised curriculum, instead of the curriculum in effect at the moment of their initial admission, he or she will be evaluated

J. Withdrawal of courses and incompletes - For the purpose of determining academic eligibility, all courses graded as incomplete (I) with A, B, C or D will be considered as approved. Courses graded as 1-F and dropped courses (W) will be considered as attempted and not approved, as is the case of failed courses (F). Withdrawal of courses (W) are not used for the computation of the student's grade point average (GPA). K. Summer courses in the campuses where the summer session is not part of the regular academic year - Courses taken during the summer sessions may be used to compensate for deficiencies in grade point average (GPA) and in the percentage of courses approved during the previous academic year. L. Repeated courses - For the purpose of financial aid benefits, a student may repeat courses, according to current institutional rules, as long as he or she does not attempt more than 150% of the total number of credits required by his or her degree program. However in order for a repeated course to be counted towards your enrollment status for financial aid purposes, you may only repeat a previously passed course once (a total of two attempts).  If you enroll in a previously repeated and passed course for a third time, this course will not count towards your enrollment for financial aid purposes. The second time a student registers is a repeated course, the student will be charged a fee as established by University Bylaws. M. Evaluation - The evaluation of academic eligibility will be done at the end of each academic year, as defined by each campus.  Class Attendance  Class attendance is mandatory at the University of Puerto Rico. Unjustified absences may have a negative effect on a student's participation in financial aid programs.  Notification procedure  Students will be able to review their academic progress through the Student Portal at the end of the academic year.  Students who do not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements will also be able to view additional information regarding their Academic Progress evaluation.  Students receive prior warnings which he or she can also review in the Student Portal.   Revision Procedure  A student who has valid reasons for not complying with Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements may appeal in writing to the Institutional Committee of Revision for Financial Assistance. This Committee is composed of representatives from each Faculty and one representative from the Office of the Dean of Students.           Appeals  The student has the opportunity to appeal to the Dean of  Students if the notification sent by the Institutional Committee of Revision for Financial Assistance is not satisfactory, within ten working days after receiving the notification.    Financial Aid Probation  A student who has a successful appeal will be placed on Financial Aid Probation. If  determined, based on the appeal, that the student will require more than one payment period to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress standards, the student will be placed on probation and an academic plan will be designed.

Its mode of operation is through interdisciplinary working teams from several engineering and business disciplines.  This is a coordinated effort between Industrial, Electrical & Computer, and Mechanical Engineering.  The goals of these laboratory facilities are to provide the following: • Basic training to students through course labs and project initiatives • Practice based experiences dealing with all aspects of an actual manufacturing system. • A space where local manufacturing industry issues can be studied. • A place where modern production technology and techniques can be studied as they are applied in an integrated manufacturing system. • The opportunity to assist local manufacturers in the development of their production system. • Incubator facilities where products and process can be developed or improved. • Serve as a meeting place where people from several disciplines can meet and learn to work in teams, and get an appreciation for the technical aspects of the other's area of knowledge.  Currently, this laboratory houses a for-profit manufacturing activity and provides students with an exemplary manufacturing experience inside the university.  The factory hosts a surface mount technology (SMT) printed circuit assembly (PCA) line and a three-axes CNC milling machine in which production and prototype runs are performed.  As for-profit initiatives are defined, students receive pay for their involvement, similar to a COOP experience.  These students are then ideal candidates for course projects and summer and COOP internship in related endeavors.  Such young but experienced graduates are then positioned to initiate new business ventures or play lead roles in interested recruiters. Various companies (notably Hewlett Packard, Fuji America and FeatureCam) have contributed to this initiative, which has been active for over ten years.

Most of the collections are from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic; the herbarium is especially rich in collections from western Puerto Rico and the islands of the Mona Passage (Desecheo, Mona, and Monito). It also includes collections from other geographical areas, including North America, Central America, South America and Europe.    Our herbarium also includes about 3500 historical collections, mostly from 1885 to 1925.  Some of the important historical collectors represented in the collection include O. W. Barrett, E. G. Britton, N. L. Britton, O. W. Hess, and F. L. Stevens. The herbarium also have important collections from A. González-Más and A.H. Liogier. The MAPR herbarium is a depository of 60 Type specimen collections, mostly from Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic. It also hosts the largest bryological collection in Puerto Rico.    Important contemporary collectors that are well represented in the collection include G. J. Breckon, J. Veléz Gavilán, and O. Monsegur Rivera. The herbarium has exchange programs with various institutions, the most active of which are with the Jardín Botánico Nacional Dr. Rafael M. Moscoso (JBSD), Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, the U. S. National Herbarium (US), Washington, D.C., US-FWS, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K), England, U.K. Over the years we have had active participation in endangered species projects to provide data and characterization of habitats for rare and endangered species in the Puertorrican bank, including the characterization of TIPAS (Tropical Important Plant Areas) in the BVI.  Other collaborative agreements have included activities such as mounting herbarium specimens for the U.S. National Herbarium, and collecting seeds for the Millennium Seed Bank.    The herbarium is located in the Biology building  and is open to the university community and  general public. The collection is databased using BRAHMS, and is available at: http://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/mapr.   Beginning in 2017, the MSM herbarium, the “Herbario Marino Puertorriqueño,” has been transferred to the Biology building and is in the process of being maintained and curated by the MAPR staff and students as a distinct herbarium. The MSM collection includes about 35,000 specimens of marine algae, primarily from across the Caribbean. Important collectors include M. A. Howe, H. G. Schweiger, M. Díaz-Piferrer, H. L. Blomquist, L. R. Almodóvar, G. R. Smith, J. E. Tilden, and H. J. Humm. The MSM collection is in the very initial steps of being databased.   The MAPR and MSM herbaria are two of the six formal herbarium collections located in Puerto Rico, among the approximately 35 herbaria located within the West Indies.

UPRM Undergraduate Catalogue 2023-2024                                                                                                                             37    Museo de Entomología y Biodiversidad Tropical del Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez “Museum of Entomology and Tropical Biodiversity of the Mayagüez Campus”  The “Museo de Entomología y Biodiversidad Tropical del Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez” (MEBT) is one of a group of seven diverse university-based museums within the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) system.  The museum, which opened in 1997, is linked to the identity and history of the Agricultural Land-Grant University at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM).  The MEBT contains the oldest and largest active insect collection in Puerto Rico.  An accession number catalogue, which includes biological documentation of individual collections since 1910, supports its valuable specimen holdings.  The rich chronicle of this collection is tied to the history of entomological research in Puerto Rico. It has been fundamental to the island’s agricultural development, and continues to serve as a unique source of information for students, researchers, and the public at large.  MEBT’s building is 1,300 m2, and includes: a large environmentally controlled room equipped with a new Burroughs cabinet compactor system, with a storage capacity of 2,000 Cornell drawers to house the collection; two exhibit rooms, six offices, a conference room, a curatorial laboratory, and a large storage area.   Taxonomically, MEBT’s insect collection is the most important repository of Hexapoda in Puerto Rico, containing specimens from every island in the “Puerto Rican Bank”, which encompasses a rich diversity of taxa and ecosystems that span the Central Caribbean.  Twenty-three insect orders are represented in MEBT holdings.  Estimates of species numbers exist for a limited number of groups, owing particularly to the attention received from different entomologists throughout its history.  Groups such as Diptera (Muscidae), Hemiptera (Auchenorrhyncha and Heteroptera), Thysanoptera, Coleoptera (Coccinellidae and Chrysomelidae), and Lepidoptera (Pyraloidea, Noctuidea, Rhopalocera) are generally well curated and identified.  Other groups remain housed in drawers organized by family.  We estimate that less than 20% of specimens have been expert-identified to the level of species.   MEBT information assets also include a biologically invaluable accession number catalogue that contains documentation of over 20,000 individual collections since 1910.  This remarkable catalogue contains prized biological information, such as host plant records, behavioral and ecological annotations, climatic and weather observations going back over a century ago.  Other important historical documents, such as letters, drawings and photos, and other artifacts comprise other MEBT collections.  As an integral part of the University of Puerto Rico, the insect collection is a well-used educational resource, both for its faculty and for its students.  Specimens from its holdings are regularly used in several entomology courses offered by our institution, such as: Introduction to Entomology, Insects of Tropical Crops, Integrated Pest Management, Biological Control, and Undergraduate Special Research Topics.

All 26 Puerto Rican orders are represented (see Maldonado Capriles 1996), including obscure groups such as Protura and Zoraptera. The collection harbors some of the earliest records of insects from ecologically valuable areas such as Guánica, Maricao, and Mona Island including specimens from José Ramos’ (1946) pioneering survey. The holdings are particularly strong in Neotropical Collembola, corresponding to the José Mari Mutt collection. The taxonomic coverage for these groups is very thorough thanks to extensive personal collections throughout the Caribbean in the 1930s to 1970s (primarily Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Jamaica), exchanges with colleagues, and purchasing of specimens from South America (primarily Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, and Chile). Both the Puerto Rican Coleoptera and Diptera are well represented and identified. The Hymenoptera, on the other hand, are lacking in the parasitoid lineages. Finally, the Lepidoptera holdings are strongest in the Puerto Rican butterflies is also quite good. All total we have around 52,000 specimens many of which are of historical importance. Regarding the non-hexapods, the valuable mollusks shell collection assembled by Carlos Aguayo contains nearly 9500 catalogued specimens. It is notable for its strong representation of species in the genus Cerion Roding (Gastropoda: Ceriidae) from the Antilles. There are also approximately 1230 specimens of Crustacea. Data of holdings of non-hexapod type specimens are not available at this time. The holdings of UPRM-INVCOL are presently increasing at an annual pace of 2-5k specimens.

DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY SCIENCE  US ARMY ROTC  Mission  Military Science at the University of Puerto Rico is presented under the provisions of the National Act of June 3, 1916, as amended, which established the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) Program at colleges and universities throughout the United States.   The mission of the US Army ROTC Program is to obtain well-educated, commissioned officers in sufficient numbers to meet Army requirements.  The objectives of the ROTC Program are to attract, motivate, and prepare selected students to serve as commissioned officers in the regular Army, Army National Guard, or the Army Reserve; to provide an understanding of the fundamentals, concepts, and principles of military science; to develop leadership, managerial skills, basic professional knowledge, and a strong sense of personal integrity, honor, and individual responsibility among students in the program; and to develop an appreciation of’ the requirements for national security.  The Army ROTC program draws upon the many educational disciplines required for the modern Army.  It ensures that men and women educated at a broad spectrum of institutions of higher learning are commissioned annually in the Army Officer’s Corps.     Vision  In the future, the Army ROTC program will continue to be the major source of newly commissioned officers for the active Army and reserve components.   GENERAL EDUCATION  The Army ROTC offers college students a four-year program composed of two separate year programs; the two-year basic course (CIMI 3011-3012, CIMI 3021- 3022) and a two-year advanced course (CIMI 4011-4012, CIMI 4021-4022).  Credits obtained in these courses will be included in the student’s general grade point average.  Deans may consider these courses as general electives for academic credit by granting up to a maximum of 12 credit-hours.   The basic course is conducted on a voluntary basis as an elective.  Students may drop the course at any time as they would any other elective.  Students must satisfactorily complete both years of studies, in order to be eligible for the advanced course.  The advanced course is optional and selective.  The ROTC furnishes all required uniforms and equipment for both basic and advanced courses.  All students that contract with the ROTC with the intent of receiving a commission as an Army officer will receive a tax-free stipend of $420 per month.   Students may qualify to enter the advanced course without completing the basic course if they have completed the U.S. Army Basic Combat Training.  Students may also qualify to enter the Advanced Course by attending a summer camp offered by the ROTC called the Basic Camp.  Basic Camp is a 32-day training event designed to introduce Cadets to the Army.  The objective is to develop Cadet leadership skills and train them on individual and junior leader tasks to develop and reinforce Warrior Ethos and our Army Values.  Basic Camp provides the critical thinking skills necessary to succeed in ROTC, and, ultimately, the Army.  Students may attend the camp and decide not to pursue ROTC if they choose.    Students in the Advanced Course are required to attend a paid summer camp known as the Advanced Camp (AC) between their third and fourth years.  Advanced Camp is a 35-day training event that is designed to assess a Cadet’s ability to demonstrate proficiency in basic officer leadership tasks.  Cadets are evaluated on their

Cadets are mentally and physically tested during a 12-day consequence driven field training exercise that replicates a combat training center rotation.  Successful completion of the Advanced Camp is a prerequisite for commissioning.   Students requesting admission to the advanced course, senior division, are screened and tested by the Professor of Military Science (PMS).  These students must satisfy requirements established by the Department of the Army before they are formally enrolled.   A.  Basic Course Requirements: 1.  Enrollment in a baccalaureate or graduate degree program full time (12 credits or more). 2.  2.00 GPA or better to enter second year of basic course. 3. Enrollment in the ROTC English program or satisfy the English requirement by approving an examination.   Note: Cadets will not fail the basic courses for lack of English skills.  ROTC will prepare cadets in this area (75 ECLT,  2/1 + OPI).   B.  Advanced Course Requirements:  1.  2.00 GPA or better. 2.  Be medically qualified (Medical exam is free of charge). 3.  Be a full-time student (12 credits or more). 4.  Score 80 or more on Comprehension Level Test (ECLT)* and 2/2 on the OPI. 5.  Having four semesters left including the ROTC classes according to the CC Form 104-R Academic Program Worksheet.   Program Outcomes:   The goals, objectives and assessment plans for the Military Science Department are outlined below. The ROTC Program objective and assessment strategies are consistent with the goals of the U. S. Army in preparing students to become commissioned officers.  We are responsible for providing men and women valuable skills such as self-discipline, personal development, problem solving and knowledge to complete demanding missions entrusted to them.   A program for tomorrow’s leaders.  Army ROTC enrolls well-rounded students with the proven ability to set goals and achieve high standards of excellence in academics, fitness and leadership in their schools and communities.  Critical Success Factors   • Meet or exceed enrollment goals.  • Increase program retention rates.  • Pursue strategies to maintain a Corps demographic    profile that promotes and reflects diversity.  • 100% graduation of Cadets from the Advanced    Camp (AC)  • 100% graduation of Cadets from the Basic Camp (BC)   ROTC Scholarship Program   The Department of the Army grants scholarships to selected outstanding students enrolled in the ROTC Program.  The scholarships, ranging from two to five years, include full tuition and laboratory fees, $1,200 a year for textbooks, and a living allowance of up to $5,000 per semester or $10,000 for tuition each academic year that the scholarship is in effect.  In addition, ROTC scholarship students receive approximately $1,100 for attending Advanced Camp (AC).   Website: https://www.uprm.edu/army/    FACULTY   LIEUTENANT COLONEL JASON T.

It was established in order to integrate within a unit several UPRM programs which were not administered jointly:  the summer program, the evening program and the Saturday course program.  The inclusion of these three programs as a new academic unit has served as basis for innovative and extended services in non-traditional fields.   Goals and Objectives  The goals of the Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies are to attend the special educational needs at the university level or those related to university work that are not presently addressed by traditional offerings in order to foster a closer collaboration  between the university’s physical and human resources and the community’s problems and needs.  Objectives:   1. To provide educational opportunities for the adult working population and for adults who have interrupted their schooling.  2. To provide educational opportunities to disadvantaged groups, minorities, and other sectors of the community not benefiting from traditional offerings. 3. To initiate educational programs and credit courses in response to educational needs that have not been fulfilled by traditional offerings. 4. To create continuing education offerings for professional groups. 5. To identify continuing education needs of the community at large and provide  courses and educational experiences to meet these needs. 6. To provide the community  with information and orientation services. 7.  To develop awareness and sensitivity to the   needs of the community and undertake initiatives to meet those needs.  The Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies addresses its goals and objectives through various initiatives such as the creation of projects, educational offerings, and  programs which are transitory in nature and short in duration.  At present, the work of the Division consists of the following programs: 1. Continuing Education Program 2. Special Training Programs 3. Community Services  4. Education Program 5. Online Education Resource Center  Continuing Education Program  Continuing Education is recognized as a growing need for all adults. The Division offers educational options on weekdays, evenings, and Saturdays in order to enable working adults to further their education.  It also fulfills different needs for children, adolescents, adults and elderly interested in developing their knowledge, talents, or abilities.  This non-traditional service offers continuing education hours/credits required to renew licenses and/or certifications pertaining to a variety of professions and provides educational alternatives in special areas such as business administration, microcomputer applications, technical skills, arts, language, handicrafts, and sports where professional and cultural growth might occur independently of traditional degree programs. Continuing Education embraces a wide field of strategies to fulfill the teaching-learning process at different stages in formal or informal settings.  It is offered through non-credit courses, seminars, workshops, or special projects.  Special Training Programs  The Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies collaborates with community institutions, other departments and campuses of the University of Puerto Rico in the creation of these special training programs which blend the traditional offerings at the University, such as language, mathematics, and science courses, with special instruction emphasizing immediately marketable skills. Courses in these programs do not carry college credits and cannot be used to fulfill degree requirements.  At the completion of a program, however, a certificate will be issued which might serve as credential for the job market.    Division of Extension Division of Extension

Since 2013 the office is focused solely on matters related to our international students and scholars.  The Principal Designated School Official (PDSO) or Designated School Official (DSO) prepares Form I-20 for students who are admitted to the UPRM.  We work closely with the Admissions Office, the Graduate School and the Registrar’s Office, making sure that all requirements for the preparation of Form I-20 are met. This office issues Form I-20 to students admitted to the UPRM, in order for them to be able to get the entry visa into United States territory at the US Embassy in their country of origin.  We also prepare and submit H1B visa petitions on behalf of scholars that are being hired by academic departments, in coordination with such departments.   Our office also plays an important role in guidance and advising not only for our international students and scholars, but also for all administrators and faculty working with them.  Our vision is to facilitate study and work at the UPRM for foreign nationals following all federal regulations and requirements established by Student and Exchange Visitor’s Program (SEVP) and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as well as other federal agencies under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).    Every fall and spring session starts off with an orientation for all newly admitted undergraduate and graduate students.  During this orientation we emphasize the importance of maintaining status while in F1 visa classification, and we go over regulations regarding international students as contemplated in the Code of Federal Regulations: 8 CFR 214.2(f).    The Office of Immigration Affairs is continually collaborating with all academic departments and UPRM dependencies (Human Resources Office and others) giving guidance and advice on all matters relating to international students and scholars. Our PDSO is continuously keeping up to date as an active member of NAFSA (The Association of International Educators).     Contacts: Dr. Frances J.

Each year approximately 70% of the student body qualifies for financial assistance. This assistance is provided through Federal, state, institutional, and private sources. These programs include grants and scholarships which do not have to be repaid, part-time employment for students who wish to work, and loans that require repayment. The philosophy followed in rendering financial assistance is based on the principle that parents are the ones who are primarily responsible for providing financial means to educate their children. Students are also considered responsible in helping finance their college education through self-help which includes resources from assets, earnings from work, and loans to be repaid from future earnings. Some of the established requirements for financial assistance are:   •  US citizenship or eligible non-citizen.  •  Enrollment in a degree or certificate       program.  •  Not in default status in Title IV Program.  • Justified financial need.   Financial need is determined by the difference between the cost of education and the amount of aid that parents and student can contribute and the economic resources and aids that the students receive from the institution. The amount which a student may receive is determined according to students’ financial need and fund availability. In order to be considered for all financial aid programs, students must complete and submit once every academic year the Application for Federal Student Aid and all other required documents.   Financial Aid Programs   Grants and Scholarships   Private scholarships and grants are received at the University on behalf of a student.  They are administered according to criteria and guidelines specified by each donor or entity.  Our sole responsibility is to administer, a distribute each award according to those guidelines.  Federal Work-Study Program   The Federal Work-Study Program provides on campus or off-campus employment opportunities for undergraduate students with financial need. To be considered to apply for work and study you must complete the FAFSA form.  There are some eligibility requirements that a candidate must have in order to receive the award.  Even though, this opportunity serves as work experience for the participant, the revenue it’s not considered as receive from work but as a grant awarded, such as Pell, SEOG or others.

Repayment begins six months after the student graduates or ceases to be enrolled.  Our institution manages all the administrative procedure of a Direct Loan, but once the loan is awarded and disbursed, all the responsibility of the loan falls toward the student.  The Geer Loan Program is funded through a private trust donation to the Mayagüez Campus. It provides 5 percent interest loans for up to a maximum yearly amount of $1,000 based on financial need. Repayment begins 46 days after the loan proceeds are disbursed.  The student must have an impeccable record in order to be granted this type of loan.  Also, there’s an enforceable interview with the Dean of Students, in order to finally award the loan.   The Emergency or Short Term Loan are granted to students who have urgent needs for unforeseen expenses such as: books, medicines, urgent trips home and others. The maximum amount awarded is $200.00. The loans expire one month after they are granted and in case of late payment surcharges will be charged. The loan check takes 3-4 business days to arrive.

Among these are a medical exam that includes complete physical examination, laboratory tests, legal authorization, and other important documents. Evidence of immunizations record (original document) is also required. Failure to comply with submitting the required documentation will result in complications for students during the course selection periods and payment periods for these courses. The Medical Services Department has a responsibility to ensure that all students have a medical insurance plan for the duration of their University careers. The University of Puerto Rico also provides a health insurance plan through a private provider for students who are not insured through a private or government health insurance.   The university medical health plan offers medical specialists services, X-rays and laboratory tests, emergency room care, hospitalization, surgical procedures, maternity services including prenatal and postnatal care, among others. The medical insurance plan offers a selection of coverages including pharmacy, dental and/or major medical services. Some services require eligibility time.

This program offers evaluation and medical consultation by a gynecologist, as well as sexual health education, guidance in reference to abstinence, natural family planning, referrals, PAP smears tests, tests for sexually transmitted diseases, as well as education and availability of supplying contraceptive methods.   The Medical Services Department considers the social health of students a very important component of maintaining a healthy environment within the university.

It is computed by dividing the total number of honor points acquired by the total number of units of credit in which the student has received final grades.  Honor points are assigned for each grade as follows:  A= 4,   B= 3, C= 2, D= 1, F= 0.  Grades received in courses marked "W," "S," "NS," "P" or "NP" is not calculated in the student's GPA.    GPA is computed after considering all courses completed.   To determine academic progress, grades received in courses taken during summer sessions are considered in the computation of the GPA for the following academic year.  For information on the GPA for graduate students please refer to Certification 09-09 (Academic Senate at UPRM).     Provisional grades:  A provisional grade or "Incomplete" (I) may be given to a student when, for justifiable reasons acceptable to the instructor, he or she has been unable to complete the academic requirements of a given course.  The provisional grade will be computed on the basis of assigning a grade of F to the incomplete work.  If the student has made up the deficiency before the end of the following semester, the instructor will

Provisional grades that have not been changed become final at the end of the following semester.  The academic calendar specifies applicable deadlines.  Repetition of courses:    (1)  Courses in which students obtain a grade of  D, or F, or are not approved may be repeated without restrictions.  (2) If requested by a student and, after analyzing the specific academic circumstances, the Dean of the College may authorize, in exceptional cases, the repetition of a course in which a student has obtained a grade of C.  The Registrar has to be notified in writing of the authorization.   (3) If a student repeats a course, only the higher grade will be counted in the computation of the GPA, but all grades will appear on the official transcript.  Graduation index:  This is computed with honor points as defined above including only courses which meet degree requirements and have been approved with a final passing grade.   Evaluation of Student's Academic Course Work  Grading criteria will be based on academic progress utilizing the existing diverse forms of evaluation according to the nature and content of the course curriculum.  The forms and elements to be taken into consideration in the evaluation of the student's academic progress in a course will be justified by the professor. Nevertheless, at the beginning of each semester, the professor needs to  inform students of the evaluation procedure and the relative value of daily class participation, laboratory work, tests, and other aspects of a course.  Professors must offer students at least one evaluation of their academic work before the official partial withdrawal date.  Examinations and all work handed in by the student, up to two weeks before the scheduled withdrawal date will be graded and returned to the student before the last day for partial withdrawal.  Professors will allow students an opportunity to discuss grades or doubts regarding course work.  A student should discuss such matters with the professor within a ten-day period after an exam or partial work is graded.  Class Attendance and Examinations  Class attendance:  Class attendance is compulsory.  UPRM reserves the right to address individual absenteeism cases at any time.  Professors are expected to record students’ absences.  Frequent absences will affect adversely a student’s final grade, and may even result in the total loss of credits.  Arranging to make up missed work after a legitimate class absence is the student’s responsibility.  Final examinations:  A final examination at the end of the semester must occur in all courses in accordance with the academic calendar.  The professor will choose the method or instrument deemed most appropriate for an evaluation that would provide enough objective evidence for the grade awarded.  The method and weight of the final examination must be indicated in the course syllabus.  If necessary, final examinations scheduled by special arrangement must be given during the examination period prescribed in the Academic Calendar including Saturdays and Sundays.   Change in the date assigned for a final exam may only be effected with the written authorization of the respective Dean and the Registrar.  Absence from examinations:  Students are required to attend all examinations.  Students who are absent from an examination for a justifiable reason acceptable to the professor, will be given a make-up exam.  If the exam is not taken, or not duly justified the student will receive an F on the missed examination.   Review period:  A review period will be scheduled for each semester between the end of the semester and the beginning of final examinations.  During this period, students will be free of any academic obligations so that they may devote this time to study for their final examinations.  Retention Standards  At the end of the second semester the Registrar Office will analyze the student’s records to certify the regular or part-time student’s academic

Mission  Contribute to the development, through education, research and extension, of new technologies to innovate in agricultural products for humans and animals through an economically viable, sustainable, and globalized agriculture that will contribute to improvement of the quality of life in our society. Organizational Structure  The College of Agricultural Sciences is the unit within the Mayagüez Campus where formal education, research, and extension in agricultural sciences are integrated.  These three functions are mutually complementary and exist under a central scheme of a three-dimensional organization which includes the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, the Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Agricultural Extension Service.  University teaching in the field of agriculture began formally in Puerto Rico in 1911 with the establishment of the College of Agriculture at Mayagüez.  The Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Puerto Rico (AES) was originally established in 1910 as a private entity of the Sugar Producers’ Association of Puerto Rico.  In 1914, it was transferred to the Government of Puerto Rico.  With the Jones Act of 1917, the Agency became part of the Department of Agriculture and Labor, and it was given the name “Insular Experiment Station.”  In 1933, and in accordance with Joint Resolution No. 3 of the Legislature of Puerto Rico, the Experiment Station was transferred to the University of Puerto Rico.  The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created the Cooperative Extension Service. In Puerto Rico, the establishment of the Agricultural Extension Service in 1934, was made possible by an understanding between the United States Department of Agriculture and the University of Puerto Rico.     The College of Agricultural Sciences was created in accordance with Public Law No. 1, known as the University Law, which was approved on January 20, 1966, and Certification No. 13 of the Council of Higher Education, dated September 11, 1968.  The College integrated within Mayagüez Campus formal teaching, research, and extension in agricultural sciences.  A management team, composed of the Dean and Director of the College of Agricultural Sciences, the Associate Dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences, the Associate Dean and Deputy Director of the Agricultural Extension Service, and the Associate Dean and Deputy Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Director of Budget and Planning, and the Director of the Office of International Programs, directs the plans and programs of the College, in accordance with Certification No. 174 of  September 24, 1980, issued by the Council of Higher Education.  The Office of International Programs adds a dimension of hemispheric cooperation to the College of Agricultural Sciences.  Through this office, the College coordinates short course offerings to international participants and trainees; facilitates short term technical assistance to institutions in developing nations; sponsors international graduate student programs; and provides logistic support for faculty exchange and internship programs in tropical agriculture.  The Mayagüez Campus is one of two Land-Grant universities in the tropics, and the only one where Spanish is the native language (although the English language is also used extensively).  The campus provides a unique setting, and, to some extent, it is in a privileged position to serve as an international center for studies, training, and research in the fields of agricultural sciences.    Besides the library, laboratories, and farm facilities for research at the Mayagüez Campus and La Montaña in Aguadilla, facilities are also available at the Río Piedras Research Center (AES) and at six substations located in different geographic regions of Puerto Rico.  The USDA Tropical Agriculture Research Station (TARS), adjacent to the Mayagüez Campus, offers technical assistance and makes available to graduate students its library and other physical facilities for research.

The main emphasis is placed on the bachelor programs, but it includes a non-degree program in Pre-Veterinary and graduate studies at the Masters degree level.  At the undergraduate level, the College of Agricultural Sciences offers programs leading to a Bachelor in Agricultural Sciences.  Students are trained in all areas related to the science and art of modern agriculture, as well as in the ability to express themselves both orally and in writing.  In addition, the student is provided with opportunities for the development of an analytical, critical, and reflective mind.  To accomplish these aims, the College of Agricultural Sciences offers twelve programs leading to the Bachelor's degree:   § Agribusiness  § Agricultural Economics   § Agronomy § Soils § Animal Science § Crop Protection  § Agricultural Extension  § General Agricultural Sciences § Horticulture  § Agricultural and Environmental Systems § Agricultural Education  § Food Science  The College offers a non-degree program of study in Pre-Veterinary Studies for those students pursuing Veterinary Medicine and the Department of Agricultural Education offers the alternative to complete the requirements for a certificate for Teacher in Agricultural Education.  In addition the College offers the students the opportunity to complete the requirements in the following curricular sequences:  § Plant Biosecurity § Natural Resources § Food Science and Technology § Agricultural Systems (intended for students of the College of Engineering)  The College follows an interdisciplinary approach in its programs of study, which, in addition to the various specialties in the agricultural sciences, encompass teaching in natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and languages.  The goal of formal teaching is to prepare scientists, agronomists, and entrepreneurs for the development and progress of Puerto Rico’s agriculture and to provide them with the knowledge and competence in their fields of specialization, as well as with indispensable background in socio-humanistic disciplines and the positive attitudes necessary to serve the Island. In order to keep up with the new challenges that confront our society, our programs include disciplines like natural resource conservation and sustainability to achieve the goal of a sustainable agricultural business in harmony with the environment.  The first year of study is almost the same for all programs in the College of Agricultural Sciences, with the exception of the Pre-Veterinary Program.  Beginning in sophomore year, students take the required courses and the professional electives pertaining to a particular field of specialization.  All programs require students to enroll at the end of the third year of study in a summer practicum under the supervision of a professor of the department.  At the graduate level, the College of Agriculture offers study programs leading to the Master of Science degree in Animal Science, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Education, Agricultural Extension, Agronomy, Soils, Crop Protection, Food Science and Technology, and Horticulture.  For more information, refer to the Graduate Studies Catalogue of the Mayagüez Campus.  Cooperative Education Program  The Coop Program offers all qualified students majoring in Agricultural Economics, Agribusiness, Agronomy, Food Science, Soil, Animal Science, Crop Protection, Horticulture, Agricultural and Environmental Systems and General Agricultural Sciences Program an opportunity to enhance their academic preparation, acquire valuable work experience, and explore career options.  Through this program, students alternate terms of full-time study with terms of full-time paid employment.  Work experiences are supervised jointly by a mentor in the cooperating institution (private business or government agency) and a faculty member.  A fundamental purpose of cooperative education is on the job training.  Student Eligibility  To be eligible for the Coop program, students must meet the following minimum requirements: § To have a 2.50 GPA § To have completed 2 years of study, and § To register in professional courses which are considered as pre-requisites by some employers   
UPRM Undergraduate Catalogue 2023-2024                                                                                                                             81    Employment Participation The coop organization is committed, through a written agreement, to provide the student with a learning experience in the workplace and to evaluate the student’s work experience. Since during work-experience periods students are considered employees of the hiring organization, the following norms are applicable: § Student is considered an employee of the hiring organization and subject to policies and laws that relate to other employees. § Student receives compensation in the form of wages for work performed. § Student is under the supervision of the employer and performs work assigned. § Employers make hiring decisions.  The Plan  §  Work periods are integrated within the curriculum.  They do not occur before the initial school term or after the final school term has been completed.  § A student must be registered in the cooperative education course assigned and will receive six credit-hours in free electives for a minimum of two work experiences; one must take place during a regular semester.  Agricultural Experiment Station  The role of the Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) is to provide the scientific and technological base necessary for the development of the agricultural and rural sectors of Puerto Rico.   As part of its functions, the Agricultural Experiment Station also conducts agro-industrial research related to the preservation, processing and added-value of agricultural products.  The research program has incorporated urban horticulture and the assessment of quality and use of agricultural and industrial by-products.  This program is in accordance with the appropriate environmental and governmental policies.  In each field, activities are developed in both basic and applied research.  The Station has central offices and research activities at the two main research centers at Mayagüez and Río Piedras.  In addition to the main Research Centers, the Agricultural Experiment Station has six substations with a total area of more than 2,000 acres of land distributed in different geographical and ecological zones of Puerto Rico.  The Substations at Adjuntas and Corozal are located in the central, humid mountainous region.  Those at Lajas and Juana Díaz are in the dry, flat coastal southern region.  The Substation at Isabela is in the sub-humid northern region and the Gurabo Substation is in the east central region. This wide distribution allows for the evaluation of different crops and animal production systems in the ecological zones where they best adapt.  Agricultural Extension Service  The Agricultural Extension Service’s basic aim is to educate on recommended practices to maintain a prosperous agriculture, improve the quality of family life, and provide adequate orientation and guidance for youth and for the development of community resources.  The Agricultural Extension Service is the informal education branch of the College of Agricultural Sciences and offers its services through four main programs:    § Educational Programs in Agriculture, Marketing and Natural Resources § Family and Consumer Sciences § Youth and 4-H Clubs § Community Resources Development.  The administrative unit of the Agricultural Extension Service has two main offices located at Mayagüez and Río Piedras, and five regional offices located in San Juan, Arecibo, Mayagüez, Ponce and Caguas.  In addition, 55 local offices fulfill educational functions by serving the 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico.  In each of the areas served by the Agricultural Extension Service, a citizens´ committee collaborates with professional personnel in the preparation and development of annual work plans for the agency which responds to Puerto Rico's needs.   International Programs in Agriculture  The Office of International Programs in Agriculture administers a number of training and research programs in tropical agriculture, mainly through the use of external funds provided to the University by international agencies in the field of agriculture. General Education    The Office of the Dean of Academic Affairs is responsible for the dissemination of the General Education philosophy adopted by the Academic Senate. The Office also oversees General Education offerings in all our academic programs.

This program is designed to provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to work in various fields related to animal production.  Through the Animal Science Program, students are exposed to various aspects of animal production, including the management of beef and dairy cattle, poultry, swine, small ruminants, horses, rabbits, apiculture, and aquaculture. The program aims to equip students with a deep understanding of animal health and welfare, feeding and nutrition, breeding and reproduction, and the prevention and control of common animal diseases.  The curriculum also covers advanced topics such as molecular biology, product development processing, and technology in the production of milk, meat, eggs, fish, and honey. This diverse range of courses provides students with a solid foundation in both basic and applied sciences, allowing them to apply their knowledge in various industries related to animal production.  Graduates of the Animal Science Program are awarded a degree of Bachelor of Agricultural Sciences (BAS) with a major in Animal Science. This degree opens doors to a wide range of specialized occupations such as managing dairy, poultry, beef, swine, and fish enterprises. Graduates can also pursue sales positions in the feed industry, veterinary products, farm machinery, and equipment. Additionally, graduates can work in the management of milk or meat processing plants or as consultants to the Beef, Dairy, Swine, Fish, and Poultry Industry, Agricultural Extension Service, or other federal or local governmental agencies.  As students progress through the Animal Science Program, they are encouraged to explore opportunities as private entrepreneurs. This prepares them to start their own businesses related to animal production or consultancy. The Animal Science Program, therefore, not only prepares students for immediate employment but also equips them with the skills needed to create their own ventures in animal agriculture.   The Pre-Veterinary Program is a specialized program designed for students who aspire to become veterinarians. It provides a comprehensive education in the sciences, including biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, as well as courses in animal nutrition, anatomy, and physiology. The program is specifically designed to meet the admission requirements of AVMA accredited Schools of Veterinary Medicine in the United States and around the world.  Although the Pre-Vet program does not grant a degree, students who complete the program can apply for admission to the Schools of Veterinary Medicine. However, most students choose to transfer to the Animal Science Program after finishing the Pre-Vet program to obtain the Bachelor in Animal Science (BAS) degree upon completion of all requirements. This degree offers students a broad range of options for pursuing professional careers in the health-related fields such as Human Medicine, Odontology, and Pharmaceutical Sciences.  The Animal Science Department also offers a graduate study program leading to the degree of Master of Sciences in Animal Science. This program provides students with advanced training in animal science, including courses in animal behavior, genetics, nutrition, and reproduction, among others. Graduates of this program are well-prepared for careers in research, teaching, and extension services related to animal science.  Vision  The vision of the Department of Animal Science is multifaceted, with both short-term and long-term goals. In the short-term, the department aims to remain as the premier provider of undergraduate education in Animal Science in Puerto Rico, and to be recognized as a top academic unit on the island and beyond. This will be achieved by providing high-quality, student-centered education that is grounded in the principles of animal care, welfare, and production for food, fiber, recreation, and companionship.  In the long-term, the department aspires to be known nationally and internationally as an outstanding academic provider of graduate education in animal science. This will be achieved by conducting cutting-edge research in the biological sciences related to the production of food, fiber, and companion animals, and

Our goal is to provide students with the intellectual resources, skills and experiences that will enable them to be successful in their future professional endeavors. These resources should also provide them with the self-confidence necessary to contribute and engage in future challenging problems of diverse nature, in order to advance the development of our society, in the economic, scientific and educational platforms.   Vision  To be able to cooperate with ideas and be leaders of the XXI century in the preparation of professionals in the discipline of chemistry and related areas, at the national and international level. Contribute to the creation, development, and dissemination of knowledge in all classical, applied and interdisciplinary areas of chemical sciences, keeping in mind the development of our future generations.  The Department of Chemistry was founded in 1948 and offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry, which has been fully approved by the American Chemical Society since 1978. The department also offers a graduate program leading to a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Applied Chemistry and a Master of Science degree in Chemistry, the latter since 1959 (see Graduate Catalogue). The Department’s web site: http://www.uprm.edu/chemistry, offers additional information about the programs and the research interests of the faculty members involved in the program.  The Chemistry Department collaborates with the interdisciplinary Master of Science in Food Technology and the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Biotechnology programs together with the departments of Chemical Engineering and Biology and the School of Agriculture. The Chemistry Department is the largest service department offering laboratory courses within the University of Puerto Rico system.   The mission of the department is to offer students an excellent undergraduate program in chemistry by means of a formal education, research and community service, to enable them to develop as professionals in the various fields of chemistry. Students completing the program are made aware of the problems that affect the Puerto Rican and international communities; and of their responsibilities and opportunities as citizens and scientists in areas such as education, industry, government, and scientific research. The American Chemical Society (ACS) Chemistry Department’s Student Affiliate Chapter has been declared as outstanding by the ACS’s Department of Educational Activities on numerous occasions.  The department is housed in a four-story building (214,000 square feet) with modern facilities for teaching and research.  The building has 40 research and 20 teaching laboratories as well as 10 classrooms, a computer center, a visualization center, and cold and dark rooms.

Learning Economics gives students an understanding of how consumers, business managers, and government officials make choices under conditions of scarcity and the results of those choices for society. Many of the public issues that fill the mass media—unemployment, wages, taxes, public debt, budget deficit, inflation, pollution, poverty, international trade, and economic growth—are, in fundamental ways, economic subjects. The daily decisions of businesses and consumers are largely economic. Economists seek to understand the decisions of businesses, consumers, and current economic issues by developing a systematic and thorough understanding of precisely how the economic system operates, including the mechanisms by which resources are allocated, prices determined, income redistributed, and economic growth and development are promoted.  Employers demand that modern graduates have strong understanding of decision making, research and analytical skills, and how they can view issues within a national and international context. This presents many opportunities for Economics graduates. An Economics degree opens career prospects in accounting, communications, finance and banking, law, marketing and sales, public policy, public administration, health, industrial relations, international relations, insurance and actuarial work, urban and regional planning, tourism, environmental studies, among others.  The Department of Economics offers a four-year program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Economics. The program is one of only two undergraduate programs in Economics offers within the UPR system and the only in Puerto Rico offering a strong development in quantitative methods and techniques necessary for economic analysis. The program requires a two semester sequence in mathematics, one year of mathematical statistics, one semester in project evaluation and one semester course in econometrics, as well as one year seminar course in research methodology.    The degree of Bachelor of Arts in Economics is awarded after completion a minimum of 134 credits, 48 of which must be in department requirements, 56 in general education, 18 recommended electives, and 12 free electives. Students should see a departmental advisor for guidance on choosing the elective courses that best fits its personnel objectives.  The  Bachelor of Arts in Economics course requirements are organized in a manner that first provides a broad introduction to economics, then develops the theoretical tools that provide the foundation of modern economic thought, and finishes with advanced courses designed to provide greater in-depth knowledge of specific fields (such as antitrust and regulation, business cycles, development, environment, electronic commerce, industrial organization, international economics, labor markets, law, managerial economics,  money and banking, securities markets, economic planning, public finance,  transportation, tourism, urban economics, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and econometrics). Economics is frequently studied in a specialist ‘single major’ degree scheme, but it also lends itself to combination with other disciplines which is why the bachelor degree offer a range of elective courses.  Besides providing professional training to students majoring in Economics, the Department also offers courses that are part of the General Education requirements and other undergraduate and graduate programs. The general education component is designed to aid in the development of a professional that is aware not only of the technical needs associated with the economics profession, but also the general needs of society. Such individual needs involve to become proficient in communication skills in both languages, English and Spanish, in scientific and quantitative reasoning, in developing technological competency, and to be knowledgeable in a body of values, ethics, and diverse perspectives.   For major and no major student’s, economics courses must be viewed as an important component of their development as an informed, effective and responsible citizenry. Economic literacy helps students to make informed and responsible choices through their lives as consumers, savers, investors, workers, citizens, and participants in the global economy. Department courses provides invaluable insight into the necessary skills to empowered students with an economic and entrepreneurial way of thinking, to be prepared for the myriad

The degree to which students succeed in this endeavor will shape not only their futures and their fortunes, but the level of competitiveness and dynamism of the economy. In this way the Department also offers a Minor Concentration in Economics mainly design for student’s pursuing other fields in the UPRM with an interest in complementing its career development with a knowledge in economics.  The Department teaching purpose is to develop students' ability to think clearly and objectively in dealing with economic decisions and problems.

Vision  The Department of English focuses its efforts and initiatives equally in three fundamental areas: instruction, research and creative work, and service to the university community.    Mission  The Department of English, which exists in an academic environment where English is a Second Language, addresses the needs of all students who enter the UPR-Mayagüez. It directs its efforts towards the development of educated, responsible, and cultured citizens and professionals in all areas with focus in fields related to English Studies, primarily those involved with the study of Linguistics, Literature, Writing and Communication, English Education, and English as a Second Language. Graduates of department programs will be qualified to contribute in an effective manner to the social, cultural, and economic development of Puerto Rico and the world at large.   DEFINITION OF GENERAL EDUCATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH  The inclusion of English courses as part of General Education in every degree program reflects UPRM deep conviction that successful, satisfying lives require a wide range of skills and knowledge. These skills include the ability to communicate effectively. General Education, in essence, augments and rounds out the specialized education students receive in their majors and aims to cultivate a knowledgeable, informed, literate human being.           GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES To teach, develop, and improve in our students:  • Communication skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking • Critical reading, writing, thinking • Analysis, interpretation, and evaluation of sources • Problem-solving strategies/abilities • Research skills • Creative work ENGLISH COURSES THAT FULFILL GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS  With regard to the general requirements in English, three separate 12 credit-hour sequences exist within the Department of English.  A.  The Basic Sequence: INGL 3101, 3102, 3201, and one of the following courses: 3202/3209/3289.  B. The Intermediate Sequence: INGL 3103, 3104 and six additional credit-hours in Department of English courses to be chosen from an approved list of courses provided by the Department of English.  C. The Honors Sequence: Six credit-hours are granted to students by means of The Advanced Placement Examination.  Students must then take INGL 3211 and 3212 to complete their requirements.  Note that although these two courses carry 3000-level numbers, they are actually second year courses.  Academic Senate Certification 88-24 stipulates that ONLY a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Examination may be used to place entering first year students directly into second year courses by granting them six credit-hours of advanced placement.  Note: Students who start in one sequence CANNOT take courses in one of the other sequences to satisfy the university's English requirement.  For example, students in the Intermediate Sequence (INGL 3103-3104) may not take either INGL 3201-3202 or INGL 3211-3212 to satisfy their second-year requirement.   
UPRM Undergraduate Catalogue 2023-2024                                                                                                                             145    The basic sequence is for students who score below 5701 on the ESLAT (English as a Second Language Achievement Test). They will be placed in the basic sequence of courses:  INGL 3101-3102, and INGL 3201, INGL 3202 or INGL 3209 or INGL 3289 or INGL 3295.  The intermediate sequence of courses, starting with INGL 3103 and INGL 3104, is for entering students at UPR/Mayagüez who have scored above 570** on the ESLAT (English as a Second Language Achievement Test), but who have either not taken the Advanced Placement Examination in English or  scored a 3.  Students with a score of 3 on the Advanced Placement Examination will be placed in INGL 3103.  Students who successfully pass INGL 3103 and INGL 3104 must take six more credit-hours in Department of English courses in order to satisfy the university requirement in English.  The Department of English also offers additional course work in the areas of conversational English, public speaking, advanced composition, creative writing, technical writing, literature, and linguistics.  All students have an opportunity to take additional courses in English to meet their particular needs.  The Honors Program of the Department of English is obtained through a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Examination in English.  For those students who desire to major in English, the department offers a two-track program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English.  All students are required to take a common core of courses which includes:  "Introduction to Linguistics," "Phonetics," "Survey of English Literature" (two semesters), "Survey of American Literature" (two semesters), and "English Expository Writing."  Beyond these required core courses, students choose to emphasize coursework in the area of literature or linguistics.  The Department of English also works with other Departments of the University to offer students an opportunity to receive certificates in Education, Film, and Office Management.    1 Test scores used for placement are reviewed by the Department of English on a regular basis.  These numbers may The Department of English Graduate Program offers two masters: a Master of Arts in English Education (MAEE) and a Master of Arts in English Literatures (MAEL) and a graduate TESOL certificate. The MAEE  is grounded in the areas of linguistics, literature, and pedagogy.  Although students may ultimately concentrate on one of these areas, they are required to take designated courses from each area.  The program is designed for classroom teachers at all levels of instruction.  The MAEL has offerings in British, American, Anglophone Caribbean, British Post-Colonial, and Puerto Rican Literatures in English.

The Department also offers a Master I Science and advanced undergraduate courses for qualified students in the graduate programs in Biology, Physics, Marine Sciences and Civil Engineering.  The principal objectives of the Geology Program are: to prepare students for professional positions in industry, government, and for careers in academic research and teaching, to maintain the Department of Geology as a center for research in Caribbean Earth and Environmental Sciences, to develop a greater awareness of Earth Sciences in the general public through community outreach programs, and to conduct assessment of all facets of the Department.  As part of degree requirements, majors have to conduct a supervised research project in their final year.  Vision  The Department of Geology of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez seeks to provide the highest levels of education through continuous revision and expansion of our educational, research, and outreach programs in order to produce well-trained, competent, academic and professional geoscientists capable of responding to societal needs.    DEFINITION OF GENERAL EDUCATION  Each student will develop critical thinking, enthusiasm, initiative and the necessary skills to become lifelong students of Earth Sciences.  Emphasis is placed on learning basic concepts and techniques through research, in an environment that promotes the development of professionals with social, cultural and humanistic sensibility as well as profound ethical values.  In this way, the department will contribute to the enrichment of science and society through the creation and dissemination of new knowledge through scientific research.  STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES  At graduation the students that meet the graduating student profile will have:  • Proficiency in a range of basic Earth Sciences concepts • Ability to apply scientific technology and the scientific method to solve problems • Computer literacy, problem solving, math reasoning skills, critical thinking, ability to judge scientific validity, able to write and speak effectively • Up-to-date knowledge of scientific technology in Earth Sciences • Ethical values • Research experience and skills • Interest in life-long learning  The Department of Geology also works to increase awareness of Earth and Environmental Sciences in the liberal arts, education, and other science majors.  This is achieved by exposure through outreach activities such as Earth Sciences Week, our Internet pages, participation of faculty and students in national and international meetings, the Annual Geology Symposium, the Puerto Rico Seismic Network and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning System.  The Department also educates engineers in the geological concepts integral to competent engineering practices.  The Department operates the Puerto Rico Seismic Network, laboratories with analytical instruments including an x-ray diffraction spectrometer and a mass spectrometer, as well as geochemical, remote sensing and geophysical laboratories.

Curricular Sequence in Art with Specialties in Drawing, Painting, Sculpture, Engraving, Ceramics or Digital Images  The goals of these curricular sequences are to offer a specialized preparation in visual media that prepares students for graduate studies and instills a deep knowledge of an artistic medium, which will enable them to undertake a creative professional practice. This plan of study will be available for students in a Studio Art concentration who look for a sub-specialty in their area of study and will also be an alternative for students of other concentrations who wish to explore in depth a single area of study in the visual arts. These group of six sequences intends to offer the students the opportunity to direct their artistic concerns towards a specific medium in fine arts, be it drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, ceramics, or digital image in a structured way, that fosters the maximum development of their abilities and the achievement of conceptual maturity beyond the limited number of basic courses required by the bachelor’s degree. By completing one or various sequences, the student is guaranteed the opportunity to take courses in one of several directions of study within a chosen artistic medium, for example: ARTE 3121 Drawing (basic), ARTE 3131 Perspective, ARTE 3132 Drawing of the Human Figure and ARTE 3210 Portrait.  Objectives  Upon completion of one or more of the sequences, the student will be able to: • Demonstrate advanced technical mastery of a traditional art medium. • Select the most appropriate materials and techniques for the concept they want express. • Verbally articulate artistic ideas and processes. • Integrate ideas, concepts and techniques to the work carried out. • Achieve the maturity of a coherent, autonomous, artistic discourse in a work of art. • Continue graduate studies in studio arts. • Establish a professional orientation as an artist.

Academic Offerings  The Kinesiology Department offers three academic programs: (a) Physical Education in Teaching; (b) Coaching and Officiating, and (c) Sequence and/or minor concentration in Adapted Physical Education.  The bachelor’s degree in Teaching Physical Education includes all updated requirements for the Puerto Rico Teaching license in Physical Education K-12, including the general and professional minimum GPA required for certification. The approval of 21 credits in adapted physical education courses permit candidates with the Physical Education K-12 teaching license, to qualify for another license: the Adapted Physical Education teaching license.  The Kinesiology Department established an internal monitoring system of transition points for the Teaching Physical Education Program (TPEP):  Entrance: Candidates enrolled in the TPEP will receive orientation on the need to follow the curricular sequence and the importance of maintaining a minimum of 3.0 GPA in order to comply with the Puerto Rico Department of Education Teacher Certification requirement. The Kinesiology Department Academic Counselor will monitor student progress throughout the first two academic years.   Transition Point One: At the beginning of the first semester of the third year, candidates will complete a teacher disposition questionnaire in the EDFI 4205 course.      Transition Point Two: In EDPE 4215 (Theory and Methodology in Teaching Physical Education in Secondary School) and EDPE 4218(Theory and Methodology in Teaching Elementary Physical Education) students will start to work on the electronic portfolio which will include artifacts related to their teaching experiences such as: unit or lesson plans, classroom management strategies, student learning analysis through assessment and reflections.   Transition Point Three: Student teaching practicum: The candidate should have a minimum GPA of 3.0 in order to eventually become a certified teacher by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. Students will present a Teacher Candidate Work Sample (TCWS). In the TCWS the candidate has to include artifacts such as lesson or unit plans, exams with their analysis, and classroom management techniques.  Transition Point Four: Program Completion, in the student teaching course the candidate has developed an approved electronic portfolio which includes the TCWS that demonstrates the candidate's content knowledge, applied knowledge of human development and learning, sensibility to diversity, pedagogical content knowledge skills and reflective habits on the effectiveness of their practice. A group interview and a satisfaction survey will be administered to candidates.

Several advanced undergraduate courses are available as electives to qualified students.  Information concerning courses offered at DMS is available here and in the Graduate School Catalogue.  The DMS had its origins in the Institute of Marine Biology, established at the Mayagüez Campus in 1954 to promote and conduct research in this discipline.  The Institute grew to become the Department of Marine Sciences in 1968 when its scope of work was expanded to include in addition physical, chemical and geological oceanography. In 1972 a Ph.D. degree was added to the program.  The DMS is currently waiting for approval from the administration for an alternative program for working students interested in getting an advanced degree (Masters) in Marine Sciences, but do not want to get involved with a full research project, or thesis. The new program is named "Professional Master in Marine Sciences" and we hope to offer it for the Spring of 2024.  Undergraduate students interested in pursuing further studies in a marine science related disciplines are encouraged to apply for the undergraduate courses offered by the DMS.    The main departmental administrative offices and a specialized Marine Science library are located at the Mayagüez campus.  The field laboratories of the Department of Marine Sciences are situated at Magueyes Island, La Parguera on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico, approximately 38 kilometers from the main campus.       In addition to classroom-laboratory facilities, Magueyes Island counts with a running seawater system to support specimens and experimentation at indoor and outdoor locations.  The department has access to invertebrate, fish, and algae collections. Laboratories capable of sophisticated research are available. A number of vessels provide access to the coastal marine communities in the south-west coast of Puerto Rico. The 47ft Sultana supports day trips for oceanographic work, and the 35ft R/V Gaviota has been fitted as a diving support boat. A number of smaller outboard motor boats are available for shorter term trips in support of research and educational activities.      The Department maintains considerable interaction with other science departments of the UPR system by stimulating collaboration among departments and through collaboration in cross department curriculum.   Mission The mission of the Department of Marine Sciences (DMS) is to promote a greater understanding of the marine environment within the disciplines of biological, chemical, geological and physical oceanography, and related areas. The specific goals of the department are to increase knowledge in the marine sciences, educate graduate students in the marine sciences, and serve the community.  Research by faculty and students is the central focus of the department's program, and emphasizes the complementary and mutualistic relationship among these goals. The Department offers Master of Marine Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in marine sciences encompassing both the full breadth of these disciplines and the specialization needed to develop specific technical and analytical skills within a larger scientific context. The program seeks to produce graduates with a strong background in marine sciences able to critically analyze problems, and effectively communicate solutions based on the application of scientific knowledge and research. Students are prepared for careers in teaching, research, industry, as well as resource and environmental management.  Vision  The vision of the (DMS) are to increase and transmit knowledge of the marine environment by means of scientific research; service the community by applying scientific knowledge and education by means of its professors, researchers, students and graduates; contribute to social and economic development by promoting the conservation and rational use of the marine environment; provide leadership and serve as a model for graduate education

The new program “Professional Masters in Marine Sciences” will be offered as soon as it is certified by the administration. Marine Sciences education provides opportunity for interdisciplinary studies across core fields, research being a necessary fundamental component of graduate training. In addition, the department provides opportunity for undergraduate students to interact with graduate students enrolled in our department and counts with courses specifically designed for students interested in general knowledge of oceanography and physics for atmospheric sciences. Student Learning Outcomes The learning outcomes of the DMS are focused on training students that: communicate effectively; identify and solve problems, think critically, and synthesize knowledge appropriate to their discipline; apply mathematical reasoning skills, scientific inquiry methods, and tools of information technology; recognize the need to engage in life-long learning.  Courses that fulfill the general education requirements for your department The curriculum available for undergraduate students at DMS provides the opportunity for students to further develop and practice the general learning outcomes at DMS.

We also offer a Curricular Sequence in Atmospheric Science and Meteorology.  The curricula for the undergraduate degrees are covered in the following.  Students seeking information concerning the graduate program should consult the Graduate Catalogue.  The Bachelor of Science program in Physics is the traditional program designed for students who wish to obtain a solid background in the field. It prepares students to work in government and private laboratories, to pursue graduate work in physics or to teach physics at the secondary level if additional courses in education are taken to obtain the teacher's license required by the Department of Education. This program is recommended to students who would like to pursue a career in Physics.    The Bachelor of Science Program in Physical Sciences is directed specifically to the preparation of secondary school teachers in the physical sciences. The program includes most of the courses in education required for certification by the Department of Education. However, it can also be used by students who do not want to make a commitment to any of the traditional fields of study in the physical sciences and require a broader preparation in general science.  A wide variety of subjects can be chosen by students in order to fulfill free electives requirements. These include traditional choices from mathematics, chemistry, geology, computer sciences, arts and humanities and non-traditional selections from business, biology, education and engineering. Students who contemplate taking courses outside the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should consult their departmental advisor regarding the availability of such courses. Students are encouraged to choose electives wisely.  Recommended electives must be taken from the list of courses corresponding to the program of study which follows. This list is revised periodically to incorporate changes in academic offerings. Other courses might be taken only after consultation with a departmental academic advisor. Courses with the code ASTR (Astronomy) or METE (Meteorology) are offered by the Department of Physics. Only those cases determined by the Department may be accepted as recommended electives in Physics.  Mission  • The mission of the Department of Physics derives from the triple mission of the University of Puerto Rico:   • Teaching:  To educate our students to better understand and explore physical phenomena, to apply critical thinking in posing, analyzing and solving problems, and to maintain high professional standards in pursuing their careers.  • Research:  To sustain and advance research and scholarship in Physics and related disciplines. • Service:  To promote Physics as a discipline throughout the university, the local school system and the community at large. General Objectives of the Department of Physics  • To provide effective teaching of physics and related fields. • To perform and advance research in physics and related fields. • To prepare our students to compete in the job market. • To disseminate and promote scientific knowledge. • To provide to the University and the community services according to the human resources and the physical facilities of the department. • To encourage the development of interdisciplinary activities among physics or related fields and other branches of knowledge. • To promote interactions of faculty and students in the Department with industry, governmental agencies, national laboratories and other academic or research institutions.

The curricular proposes that environmental problems and issues are not only physical/natural phenomena, but also social in their causes and consequences.  Therefore, the resolution of environmental problems and issues, and the management of natural resources require the integration of multiple knowledges including the social and natural sciences, business administration and engineering. The curricular sequence seeks to diversify and enrich the student’s professional formation by exposing him/her to the sociological analysis of environmental problems and issues, to develop the necessary skills to collaborate in multi and interdisciplinary environments and to insert themselves in environmental policy processes, and to develop skills in applied social research in topics related to environmental problems, natural resources management and environmental policy.  Courses in the sequence   The curricular sequence includes 15 credits, divided into 9 credits of core courses and 6 credits of recommended electives.  The core courses will provide the theoretical and methodological foundation in the fields of environmental sociology and public policy.  The last course of the sequence, SOCI 4017, provides the integrative research experience about an environmental issue.

This is in accordance with the provisions of the congressional law known as the Second Morrill Act as amended by Congress in 1907."  Following this educational directive, engineering curricula have been designed to provide a firm educational foundation upon which engineering graduates can build social and professional competence after leaving college and become men and women of high value to modern society.  Mission  Provide a service of excellence to Puerto Rico and the world, by:  • exercising an educational work that leads to the training of professionals in engineering and related areas, capable of thinking critically and exercising leadership positions in such a way that they can contribute to technological, scientific, economic, and social development • performing service and research tasks that promote the creation, application and dissemination of scientific and technological knowledge for the benefit of our society, emphasizing innovation and the active participation of our students • developing in students the necessary skills and sensitivity to effectively solve the problems they face on a daily basis through the constant practice of the values and attitudes that should prevail in a democratic society that values and appreciates diversity   Vision  Our commitment is to prepare the best professionals in engineering and related areas, and be a major center for research, publications, and service for the technological development of Puerto Rico, the U.S., the Caribbean, Central and South America.  General Education  The General Education component in every Engineering program is designed to provide students with a preparation in subjects that surpass the boundaries of their technical disciplines.  It is our belief that a well-rounded engineering education must instill in students the ability to think critically, to communicate effectively, and to develop a fairly comprehensive understanding of human desires and aspirations, human convictions, and human behavior under varying circumstances. The College of Engineering programs have a broad education component that complements the technical content of the curriculum and is consistent with the program educational objectives.  General Education Learning Outcomes  The General Education Component in our Engineering programs is designed to provide students with ability to: 1. Become an intentional learner 2. Demonstrate creative and critical thinking 3. Communicate effectively 4. Identify, study, and propose solutions to problems; transform knowledge into action 5. Apply mathematical, scientific, and technological skills 6. Apply interpretative and integrative skills 7. Relate global contexts and issues of importance to Puerto Rico 8.

Chemical engineers apply science, mathematics, and engineering principles to the design, analysis, and control of chemical, physical, or biological processes, including the hazards associated with these processes. Chemical engineers convert raw materials or chemicals to more valuable or useful forms.  Nearly all physical phenomena can be described through the combination of the basic sciences and mathematics making chemical engineering extremely versatile. Because of this versatility, chemical engineers make valuable contributions in most fields, from food processing, pharmaceuticals production,  medical device fabrication, and energy production to artificial-organ development.   There are several fundamental physical phenomena that are important to engineers as they develop and implement a chemical process. These form the common educational basis of all chemical engineers, and include: conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, reaction engineering, process control, safety, and economics.   The Department of Chemical Engineering also offers a formal Minor in Pharmaceutical Engineering for chemical engineering students.  Mission  To develop a strong Chemical Engineering program focused on research, services and on educating students coming from all socioeconomic levels to convert them in professionals competitive at a worldwide level and knowledgeable of their social responsibility.

Vision    We provide society with people-serving problem-solvers in civil engineering and surveying.  Mission  Provide our society with high quality professionals having a strong education in civil engineering and/or land surveying; with rich cultural, ethical, environmental, and social sensitivities; capacity for critical thinking; and the entrepreneurial skills to solve civil infrastructure problems.  Search for and disseminate new knowledge.  Provide services to solve engineering problems as members of interdisciplinary teams.  SLOGAN:  CES=(PS)2     (Civil Engineers and Surveyors = People-Serving, Problem Solvers)  Webpage:  https://www.uprm.edu/inci/   CIVIL ENGINEERING  Civil Engineering is one of the most demanded professions currently in the United States and Puerto Rico ranking among the top in engineering careers.  It has played and will continue to play a protagonist role in the safe, sustainable, and resilient planning, preparedness, response, recovery and reconstruction of the national and Puerto Rico’s civil and natural infrastructure after the natural disasters and other challenges our local and national community face.    Civil Engineering is the oldest of the traditional divisions of engineering, encompassing a broad range of public and private infrastructure projects for improving the world's large-scale environment with the most innovative and up-to-date technology.  It is an exciting profession full of state-of-the-art computer and web-based applications which go from virtual reality studios, computerized modeling and simulation of civil of virtual scenarios, physical and laboratory scale modeling and state of the art geospatial analyses and design with on line resources to understand, assess and design our built and natural civil infrastructure. Highways, bridges, railroads, dams, docks and wharves, airports, launching facilities, multistory buildings, industrial structures, water, air, and land conservation and protection, and water distribution systems, industrial and residential waste treatment systems, tunnels, and transit systems supported by computer aided design and geographical information systems (the country's infrastructure) are examples of the work performed by civil engineers.  Each work has an impact upon the daily living of most people.  Civil engineers, therefore, are called upon to consider, in an integrated manner, the social and physical factors which affect the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of our total infrastructure systems. Since Puerto Rico is located in a high-risk prone area for natural hazards, therefore, mitigation activities have become a continuous part of our work in order to become more sustainable and resilient.    The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Program in Civil Engineering (C.E.)  is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The program has been also designed to meet the needs and the qualification criteria of the Board of Examiners of Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors of Puerto Rico and the Professional College of Engineers and Surveyors of Puerto Rico (CIAPR),

The CSE department hosts two undergraduate programs leading to the degrees of (1) Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciences and Engineering (BS CSE) and (2) Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BS SWE). It also offers a Minor Concentration in Computer Science and Engineering.   At the graduate level, the department offers a Ph.D. degree in Computing and Information Sciences and Engineering (CISE) jointly with the Mathematical Sciences Department of the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM). Details about this program are provided in the UPRM Graduate Catalog.  Mission  To create, share, and apply knowledge in Computer Science and Software Engineering for the benefit of society. To provide students with the high-quality education that enables them to contribute to the economic and well-being of humanity, observing the highest standards of ethics and effectiveness in the exercise of the computing profession.  Vision  To be one of the nation’s leaders in Computer Sciences and Engineering education and research.  Objectives  The CSE department is committed to excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching, research, and service aiming to contribute to the socioeconomic development of Puerto Rico through:  • The education of a diverse, well-rounded, entrepreneurial engineering workforce with a keen sense of social responsibility and a vocation for global engagement.  • The production of new knowledge and the transfer of technology.  • The cultivation of strong ties with community, governmental, and non-governmental organizations.   Personnel and Facilities  The CSE department is supported by an outstanding staff that includes academic counselors, administrative officers, assistants, and secretaries that are committed to offering our students and faculty the administrative support that they need.   All CSE/SWE faculty members hold doctoral degrees in Computer Science and Engineering or closely related fields and are active in science and education research.  In addition to the physical spaces of the department’s main facilities (S-220) and offices for our faculty, the department manages, or has access to, a group of well-equipped computing labs, all with access to the UPRM high bandwidth Internet infrastructure. All those labs are connected, through a high bandwidth local area network to a cluster of high-capacity virtualized servers that efficiently satisfy the computing and data storage needs of our students and faculty. That computing infrastructure includes state-of-the-art hardware and software systems, as well as a high-speed communication infrastructure. They are used to support the hands-on activities in closed-lab sessions, in workshops, and in lectures; and, when not in use for that type of activity, they are also available to our students, either through direct or through remote access, all the time.   Undergraduate Experience  Our goal is to offer a rich and sound educational experience that in addition to challenging curriculums, also includes a wide range of hands-on educational activities such as internships, COOPs, undergraduate research, and student organizations. We encourage our students to explore and to be part of these opportunities for all the benefits that they represent; moreover, nowadays, these types of experiences are seriously looked at by employers.  Internships and COOP programs allow students to spend summers or entire semesters working on a real project in the industrial or corporate world, or

They represent excellent opportunities for our students to experience an early embedment with real Computer Sciences and Engineering professionals, as well as with Software Engineering professionals. Through them, the students get to be known in the same environment in which they are expected to exercise their profession upon graduation, hence representing doors of opportunities that will be open upon graduation. In addition, our students have a wide variety of opportunities to get involved in undergraduate research projects, either on campus or through internships at other academic or research institutions throughout the nation. Through them, the CSE/SWE students engage in research or development projects, expanding their knowledge and reinforcing their creativity. The previous opportunities may also represent an important source of income to support the financial needs of students.   Students are encouraged to be part of student associations or societies to work on projects of common interest or to serve others. Various student associations, such as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the IEEE Computer Society, the ACM Society, etc., count with a significant membership of CSE/SWE students. In addition, students have access to be part of competitive team projects that represent an excellent opportunity to put in practice their skills and to improve them by working on solutions to practical and challenging problems while competing with students from other well-recognized institutions.

Undergraduate Programs  The CSE department administers the two undergraduate programs: (1) Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciences and Engineering (CSE program), and (2) Bachelor of Science Program in Software Engineering (SWE program). Both programs were designed in alignment with the guidelines provided by the Computing Curricula 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computer Society (IEEE-CS). Their curricula include advanced elective courses for tailoring the study programs to the student’s particular professional interests. The department also hosts a Minor Concentration in Computer Science and Engineering.   The CSE program and the SWE program have a strong common core, with minor differences that are concentrated in the second half of the two programs. They come mostly from the additional requirements that SWE students must fulfil in areas that are specific to the discipline. Consequently, graduates of the SWE program share with graduates of the CSE program a wide formation in aspects of analysis, design, and implementation of computing systems. The CSE program also cover more theoretical foundations of the Computing discipline and allows the student to choose from a pool of advanced courses on trending areas in which the discipline is currently impacting our modern society. On the other hand, the SWE program offers advanced courses on well-structured, systematic, and quantitative methodologies for the development, operation, and maintenance of complex, mission-critical computational systems. This latter curricular segment is the core of the Software Engineering specialty.   Details about each undergraduate program are given in the following sections.   Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciences and Engineering  The Bachelor of Science Program in Computer Sciences and Engineering is jointly accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) and the Computer Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  The internal program code number for this program is 0508.

Aligned with that, the ECE department started the Industrial Affiliates Program (IAP) in 1989 to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in research and development projects under the sponsorship of industry and government agencies. Several of our students have benefited from this program by having the opportunity to work in real and challenging problems. Every year, participating students have the opportunity to present their results to all the community in Campus, as well as to visitors from sponsoring organizations.  Students in our programs have access to a wide spectrum of other opportunities during the regular semesters or during summers. In particular, they usually have the opportunity to work in campus, internships in other universities, in national research labs or in different industries, in Puerto Rico and throughout the States, and occasionally in other countries as well. All these opportunities have an extraordinary impact in their education and formation in many aspects. They represent an excellent experience that is valuable not only for their studies but also for their future practice as a computer or electrical engineer. They are also excellent in providing an attractive source of income, which the student can use to support his/her financial needs while in school.   Most of these experiences can be counted as part of the credits that the student needs to complete the degree by registering in undergraduate research courses (INEL 4998 and ICOM 4998), the Practice in Engineering course (INEL/ICOM 4048) or the Cooperative Education Program (INEL/ICOM 4995).

Electrical Engineering integrates mathematical and scientific principles of electricity and magnetism to analyze electrical phenomena and to design electrical systems. Electrical and electronic systems are present in almost any aspect of our daily lives, ranging from the generation of electrical power vital to the social and economic well-being of society, to appliances, instruments, and devices at home and at work. Therefore, our Electrical Engineering program is designed to prepare students for a wide-range of professional activities involving design and implementation of electrical systems.  The profession of Electrical Engineering has evolved to encompass many fields of specialization.  In recognition of that fact, the undergraduate program is structured into a common core sequence of courses which provides a broad coverage of the areas which Electrical Engineers are expected to master, and a cluster of technical electives which study closely at least one area of emphasis within the discipline.  Current options include:  • RF Systems and Microwave Remote Sensing • Communications and Signal Processing • Control systems • Electronics • Power and Energy Systems  Electronic devices and systems are the core of all modern communication, information processing, control, and automation systems present in industrial and consumer use.  The electronic collection, transmission, and processing of information are vital to support the needs of society.  Signals need to be transmitted efficiently for a wide variety of applications, from entertainment to space exploration.  The success of an industrial society depends on the production of high-quality goods and services, which in turn require effective robotic and automation systems. Since computer systems are present in all aspects of the engineering practice, the program incorporates the use of computerized analysis, design techniques, and tools where appropriate.  The curriculum incorporates laboratory courses in Chemistry, Physics, Electronics, and Electrical Machinery to allow students practical experiences with physical and engineering principles.  Technical electives provide structured design experiences where students learn to design practical systems with real world constraints.

The program is administered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering.  Mechanical engineers are present in almost every industry.  For example, a mechanical engineer might work in product development, manufacturing processes, and science/technology development among others engineering areas. A mechanical engineer can make significant contributions to almost any industry due to our broad curricular education and outstanding professional opportunities available to our students. Efficiency and performance are two criteria that a mechanical engineer would try to maximize. Most fundamentally, they apply the principles of two physics’ fields—mechanics and heat—to the design of machines.  Heat is one of the principal forms in which we use energy, so mechanical engineering is fundamental to all processes in which energy is produced and used.  The field of mechanics is divided into the sub-fields of solid mechanics and fluid mechanics, and both of these sub-fields are basic to mechanical engineering.    Students wishing to develop a strong engineering basis to their work in Bioengineering, Aerospace Engineering, Automotive Engineering and Renewable Energy are encouraged to pursue their interests in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.  These engineering areas are interdisciplinary fields that include design, dynamics, solid mechanics, controls, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, robotics and manufacturing.  Mechanical engineering is a growing field, as technology and mechanization continues to grow and improve.  Mechanical engineers can work in a large variety of fields and settings, making them very versatile and employable.  Many of the technological advances that we now take for granted were made in collaboration with mechanical engineers.  Some examples are: Agricultural Mechanization, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration, Space Exploration, Bioengineering, Computer Aided Design Technology, Electronic Products, Power Generation, Airplanes, and Automobiles.  Mission  Enabling the preparation and formation of mechanical engineering leaders for Puerto Rico and the world by encouraging creativity, teaching analytical ability, inculcating professional ethics and ingraining lifelong learning.   Vision  Influence the frontiers of Mechanical Engineering locally and globally through competency, coherence and commitment.  Program Educational Objectives  Based on the major program objectives, and after surveying our constituents, the following general skills and competencies are required of our graduates during the first five years after graduation.  These skills and competency requirements constitute the Program Educational Objectives (PEOs): 1. Interact and function in a multicultural and multidisciplinary environment. 2. Address the challenges of fast moving changes and newly emerging areas in the profession. 3. Provide quality and ethical contributions to the profession, society and engineering knowledge base. 4. Become leaders and team-builders. 5. Be self-motivated to pursue life-long learning.  The Bachelor of Science Program in Mechanical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  Student Outcomes The ME program adheres to the 1-7 Student Outcomes of the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. These outcomes are defined as the skills and competencies that

Minor in Aerospace Science and Engineering Students graduating in or after Fall 2014-15 may elect to complete one optional emphasis within Mechanical Engineering. A BSME emphasis will indicate high academic achievement in the area of specialization. The general requirements of the emphasis’s areas are: • A 3.0 GPA (‘B’ average) must be earned for the three technical electives within the emphasis.  Aerospace Science and Engineering  The goal of the emphasis area is to educate mechanical engineering students to identify and solve aerospace-related problems in the fields of structures, propulsion and aerodynamics. Aerospace Science and Engineering can be defined as the combination of aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Aeronautical Engineering deals with the whole field of analysis, design, manufacturing, maintenance, testing, and use of aircraft. It involves the knowledge of aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, flight mechanics, avionics, and other related areas. Astronautical engineering is closely allied to aeronautics, but is concerned with the flight of vehicles in space, beyond the earth's atmosphere, and includes the study and development of rocket engines, artificial satellites, and spacecraft for the exploration of outer space.  As there is a certain degree of technology overlap between the two fields, the term Aerospace is often used to describe them both. Hence, Aerospace Engineering can be defined as the analysis, design, manufacturing, and use of aircraft and/or spacecraft. Aerospace Engineering is a very diverse field with a multitude of commercial, industrial and government applications.    Typical Aerospace Science and Engineering programs are designed for students who desire to learn about flight, whether in the atmosphere or in space. Programs typically begin with basic study of engineering principles, such as structures, thermodynamics, statics, and design and as the programs progress, students move on to the study of propulsion, control systems, and aerodynamics. Graduates gain a high level of technical expertise that will serve them well in various engineering occupations, such as those within industry and government.   Student profile  Students completing the emphasis area will have the ability to apply fundamental principles (e.g., math, science, and engineering) and use analytical and numerical methods to solve problems in aerospace sciences.  Learning Objectives  Throughout the emphasis area, students will be exposed to the following educational and learning objectives: 1. Apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering. 2. Identify, formulate and solve aerospace engineering problems.
