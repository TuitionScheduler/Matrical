        <h2>Our Genesis</h2>
        <p>
          We will save students at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez
          (UPRM) time every single academic term by redefining the cumbersome
          pre-registration process that has long been a source of frustration
          for students.

        <h2>An Innovation in Pre-Registration</h2>
        <p>
          Aimed at slashing pre-registration time to less than 10 minutes,
          Tuition Scheduler offers a lifeline to students drowning in scheduling
          conflicts when trying to make their schedule for an upcoming academic
          term. Imagine a world where selecting courses is the only step you
          take, and the cumbersome task of piecing together a conflict-free
          schedule is handled with grace by our sophisticated algorithm.

        <h2>Beyond UPRM</h2>
        <p>
          Tuition Scheduler is tightly coupled with UPRM (this has allowed us to
          develop quickly and ship our solution to students for feedback), but
          we have identified that many college's course enrollment landscapes
          would greatly benefit from our solution. S
